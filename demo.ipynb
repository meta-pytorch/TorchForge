    "# Intro to Forge\n",
    "\n",
    "Forge is a PyTorch-native framework designed for rapid experimentation and large-scale training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs). It's designed to:\n",
    "- Express RL algorithms as naturally as psuedocode, while scaling seamlessly across clusters\n",
    "- Support varying degrees of asynchrony - from fully synchronous/on-policy, to fully asynchronous/off-policy training\n",
    "- Separate infrastructural concerns from algorithmic implementation\n",
    "- Bias towards composable, reusable components that can be mixed and matched for different RL approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "Forge is built on top of proven components:\n",
    "- **[Monarch](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch)** - PyTorch-native single-controller framework\n",
    "- **[torchtitan](https://github.com/pytorch/torchtitan)** - PyTorch-native large-scale LLM training platform\n",
    "- **[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm)** - A high-throughput, memory efficient inference and serving engine for LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "Our mission is to accelerate innovation in reinforcement learning by empowering researchers and developers to explore new RL algorithms and infrastructure techniques. Whether you're designing novel training methods or optimizing distributed systems, Forge provides a foundation to build upon."

    "## Brief Intro to Monarch\n",
    "Before diving into Forge, we need to first establish the foundation. Forge is built on top of Monarch, PyTorch's native single-controller framework for distributed execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forge builds many of its abstractions on top of Monarch, so it's worth introducing a few of its key concepts first. The following sections borrow from Monarch's Getting Started Guide (not public yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining an Actor\n",
    "At its core, Monarch uses [actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) as a way to create multi-machine programs. Actors are Python objects that expose a number of endpoint functions. These functions can be called by other actors in the system and their responses gathered asynchronously."
